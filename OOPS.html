<h1>OOPS Concepts</h1>
<h3><span id="what-is-oops">What is OOPS?</span></h3>
<p>Object Oriented Programming System is the programming technique to write programs based on the real world objects. The states and behaviors of an object are represented as the member variables and methods. In OOPS programming programs are organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic.</p>
<h3><span id="what-is-the-difference-between-procedural-programming-and-oops">What is the difference between Procedural programming and OOPS?</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Procedural language is based on functions but object oriented language is based on real world objects.</li>
<li>Procedural language gives importance on the sequence of function execution but object oriented language gives importance on states and behaviors of the objects.</li>
<li>Procedural language exposes the data to the entire program but object oriented language encapsulates the data.</li>
<li>Procedural language follows top down programming paradigm but object oriented language follows bottom up programming paradigm.</li>
<li>Procedural language is complex in nature so it is difficult to modify, extend and maintain but object oriented language is less complex in nature so it is easier to modify, extend and maintain.</li>
<li>Procedural language provides less scope of code reuse but object oriented language provides more scope of code reuse.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What is Object Oriented Programming?</strong></h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming or popularly known as OOPs is a programming model or approach where the programs are organized around objects rather than logic and functions. In other words, OOP mainly focuses on the objects that are required to be manipulated instead of logic. This approach is ideal for the programs large and complex codes and needs to be actively updated or maintained.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the main concepts of OOPs in Java?</strong></h3>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs is a programming style that is associated with concepts like:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Inheritance:&nbsp;</em>Inheritance is a process where one class acquires the properties of another.</li>
<li><em>Encapsulation:&nbsp;</em>Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping up the data and code together as a single unit.</li>
<li><em>Abstraction:&nbsp;</em>Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation details from the user and only providing the functionality to the users.&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Polymorphism:&nbsp;</em>Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take multiple forms.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span id="what-is-abstraction">1.What is Abstraction?</span></h3>
<p>Abstraction is an OOPS concept to construct the structure of the real world objects. During this construction only the general states and behaviors are taken and more specific states and behaviors are left aside for the implementers.</p>
<p>Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user. Thus you can say that abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and revealing only the functionality to them. Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Abstract Classes</strong>&nbsp;(0-100% of abstraction can be achieved)</li>
<li><strong>Interfaces</strong>&nbsp;(100% of abstraction can be achieved)</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstraction-in-java-2/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstraction-in-java-2/</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstraction:&nbsp;</strong>Hiding the internal implementation of the feature and only showing the functionality to the users. i.e. what it works (showing), how it works (hiding). Both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-classes-in-java/">abstract class</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/interfaces-in-java/">interface</a>&nbsp;are used for abstraction.</p>
<p>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.</p>
<p>Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.The properties and behaviors of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.</p>
<p>Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract classes and Abstract methods :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An abstract class is a class that is declared with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-keyword-in-java/">abstract keyword.</a></li>
<li>An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.</li>
<li>An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods</li>
<li>A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass,thus making&nbsp;<a href="http://contribute.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-in-java/">overriding</a>compulsory OR either make subclass itself abstract.</li>
<li>Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with abstract keyword.</li>
<li>There can be no object of an abstract class.That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-operator-java/"><em>new operator</em></a>.</li>
<li>An abstract class can have parametrized constructors and default constructor is always present in an abstract class.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Can a abstract class be defined without any abstract methods?</strong><br />Yes it's possible. This is basically to avoid instance creation of the class.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if a subclass has inherited a abstract class but has not provided implementation for all the abstract methods of the super class?</strong><br />Then the subclass also becomes abstract. This will be enforced by the compiler</p>
<p><strong>Can you create an object of an abstract class?</strong><br />Not possible. Abstract classes are not concrete and hence can't be instantiated. If you try instantiating, you will get compilation error.</p>
<p><strong>Can I create a reference for an abstract class?</strong><br />Yes. You can create a reference for an abstract class only when the object being provided the implementation for the abstract class - it means that the object should be of a concrete subclass of the abstract class. This applies to interfaces also. Below is an example for interface referencing an object:java.sql.Connection con = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection("");</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3><span id="what-is-encapsulation">What is Encapsulation?</span></h3>
<p>Encapsulation is an OOPS concept to create and define the permissions and restrictions of an object and its member variables and methods. A very simple example to explain the concept is to make the member variables of a class private and providing public getter and setter methods. Java provides four types of access level modifiers: public, protected, no modifier and private.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data(variables) and code(methods) together as a single unit. Here, the data is hidden from the outer world and can be accessed only via current class methods. This helps in protecting the data from any unnecessary modification.&nbsp;We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declaring the variables of a class as private.</li>
<li>Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the values of the variables.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/</a><a href="https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/04/the-three-greatest-paragraphs-ever-written-on-encapsulation.html"><br /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/04/the-three-greatest-paragraphs-ever-written-on-encapsulation.html">Encapsulation</a>&nbsp;provides objects with the ability to hide their internal characteristics and behavior. Each object provides a number of methods, which can be accessed by other objects and change its internal data.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.Other way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Encapsulation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Hiding:</strong>The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is storing values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Flexibility:</strong>We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to omit the setter methods like setName(), setAge() etc. from the above program or if we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge() etc. from the above program</li>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong>Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Testing code is easy:</strong>Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="what-is-the-difference-between-abstraction-and-encapsulation">What is the difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation?</span></h3>
<p>Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts. On the one hand, abstraction focuses on the behavior of an object. On the other hand, encapsulation focuses on the implementation of an object&rsquo;s behavior. Encapsulation is usually achieved by hiding information about the internal state of an object and thus, can be seen as a strategy used in order to provide abstraction.</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Program to interfaces, not implementations&rdquo; is the principle for Abstraction and &ldquo;Encapsulate what varies&rdquo; is the OO principle for Encapsulation.</li>
<li>Abstraction provides a general structure of a class and leaves the details for the implementers. Encapsulation is to create and define the permissions and restrictions of an object and its member variables and methods.</li>
<li>Abstraction is implemented in Java using interface and abstract class while Encapsulation is implemented using four types of access level modifiers: public, protected, no modifier and private.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span id="what-is-polymorphism">What is Polymorphism?</span></h3>
<p>Polymorphism is the occurrence of something in various forms. Java supports various forms of polymorphism like polymorphic reference variables, polymorphic method, polymorphic return types and polymorphic argument types.</p>
<p>Polymorphism is briefly described as &ldquo;one interface, many implementations&rdquo;. Polymorphism is a characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts &ndash; specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form. There are two types of polymorphism:<img class="wp-image-45540 alignright  blur-up lazyloaded" src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-483x300.png" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-483x300.png 483w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-150x93.png 150w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-300x186.png 300w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-768x477.png 768w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-290x180.png 290w" alt="" width="300" height="187" data-src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-483x300.png" data-srcset="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-483x300.png 483w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-150x93.png 150w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-300x186.png 300w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-768x477.png 768w, https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Polymorphism-290x180.png 290w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Compile time polymorphism</li>
<li>Run time polymorphism</li>
</ol>
<p>Compile time polymorphism is method overloading whereas Runtime time polymorphism is done using inheritance and interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-java/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-java/</a></p>
<p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.</p>
<p><strong>Real life example of polymorphism:</strong>&nbsp;A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behaviour in different situations. This is called polymorphism.</p>
<p>Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word &ldquo;poly&rdquo; means many and &ldquo;morphs&rdquo; means forms, So it means many forms.</p>
<p><strong>In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compile time Polymorphism</li>
<li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compile time polymorphism</strong>: It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Method Overloading</strong>: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be&nbsp;<strong>overloaded</strong>. Functions can be overloaded by&nbsp;<strong>change in number of arguments</strong>&nbsp;or/and&nbsp;<strong>change in type of arguments</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Operator Overloading</strong>: Java also provide option to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (&lsquo;+&rsquo;) for string class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add two operands. So a single operator &lsquo;+&rsquo; when placed between integer operands, adds them and when placed between string operands, concatenates them.</p>
<p>In java, Only &ldquo;+&rdquo; operator can be overloaded:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>To add integers</li>
<li>To concatenate strings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-method-dispatch-runtime-polymorphism-java/"><strong>Runtime polymorphism</strong></a>: It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-in-java/"><strong>Method overriding</strong></a>, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be&nbsp;<strong>overridden</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>What is method overloading and method overriding?</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Method Overloading :</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but each method must have a different number of parameters or parameters having different types and order.</li>
<li>Method Overloading is to &ldquo;add&rdquo; or &ldquo;extend&rdquo; more to the method&rsquo;s behavior.</li>
<li>It is a compile-time polymorphism.</li>
<li>The methods must have a different signature.</li>
<li>It may or may not need inheritance in Method Overloading.</li>

<h3><span id="what-is-static-binding-and-dynamic-binding">What is Static Binding and Dynamic Binding?</span></h3>
<p>Static or early binding is resolved at compile time. Method overloading is an example of static binding.</p>
<p>Dynamic or late or virtual binding is resolved at run time. Method overriding is an example of dynamic binding.</p>
<h3><strong>What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch?</strong></h3>
<p>In Java, runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time. In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a&nbsp;look at the example below to understand it better.</p>

<p><strong>Can a main method be overloaded?</strong><br />Yes. You can have any number of main methods with different method signature and implementation in the class.</p>
<h3><strong>Can you override a private or static method in Java?</strong></h3>
<p>You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with the same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the superclass method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in subclass because it&rsquo;s not accessible there. What you can do is create another private method with the same name in the child class. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the example below to understand it better.</p>

<p><strong>Can we&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/can-we-overload-or-override-static-methods-in-java/">Overload or Override static methods in java</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overriding :</strong>Overriding is related to run-time polymorphism. A subclass (or derived class) provides a specific implementation of a method in superclass (or base class) at runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Overloading:</strong>Overloading is related to compile time (or static) polymorphism. This feature allows different methods to have same name, but different signatures, especially number of input parameters and type of input paramaters.</p>
<p><strong>Can we override private methods in Java?</strong><br />No, a private method cannot be overridden since it is not visible from any other class.</p>
<p><strong>Can we overload static methods? &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The answer is&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;</strong>. We can have two ore more static methods with same name, but differences in input parameters</p>
<p><strong>Can we Override static methods in java? &nbsp;</strong>We can declare static methods with same signature in subclass, but it is not considered overriding as there won&rsquo;t be any run-time polymorphism. Hence the answer is&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;No&rsquo;</strong>.&nbsp;Static methods cannot be overridden because method overriding only occurs in the context of dynamic (i.e. runtime) lookup of methods. Static methods (by their name) are looked up statically (i.e. at compile-time).</p>
<p><strong>Which class is the superclass for every class?</strong><br />Object class</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfact-48-overloading-main-in-java/">Can we overload main() method?</a></strong><br />The main method in Java is no extra-terrestrial method. Apart from the fact that main() is just like any other method &amp; can be overloaded in a similar manner, JVM always looks for the method signature to launch the program.</p>
<ul>
<li>The normal main method acts as an entry point for the JVM to start the execution of program.</li>
<li>We can overload the main method in Java. But the program doesn&rsquo;t execute the overloaded main method when we run your program, we need to call the overloaded main method from the actual main method only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a copy constructor in Java?</strong></p>
<p>Copy constructor is a member function that is used to initialize an object using another object of the same class. Though there is no need for copy constructor in Java since all objects are passed by reference. Moreover, Java does not even support automatic pass-by-value.</p>
<p><strong>What is a constructor overloading in Java?</strong></p>
<p>In Java, constructor overloading&nbsp;is a technique of adding&nbsp;any number of&nbsp;constructors to a class each having a different parameter list. The compiler uses the number of parameters and their types in the list to differentiate the overloaded constructors.</p>
<p>class&nbsp;Demo<br />{<br />int&nbsp;i;<br />public&nbsp;Demo(int&nbsp;a)<br />{<br />i=k;<br />}<br />public&nbsp;Demo(int&nbsp;a,&nbsp;int&nbsp;b)<br />{<br />//body<br />}<br />}</p>

<h3><span id="what-is-inheritance">What is Inheritance?</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/</a></p>
<p>Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.</p>
<p>A subclass can inherit the states and behaviors of it&rsquo;s super class is known as inheritance.</p>
<p>Inheritance in Java is the concept where the properties of one class can be inherited by the other. It helps to reuse the code and establish a relationship between different classes. Inheritance is performed between two types of classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parent class (Super or Base class)</li>
<li>Child class (Subclass or Derived class)</li>
</ol>
<p>A class which inherits the properties is known as Child Class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known as Parent class.</p>
<p><strong>Important terminology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Super Class:&nbsp;</strong>The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).</li>
<li><strong>Sub Class:</strong>The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.</li>
<li><strong>Reusability:&nbsp;</strong>Inheritance supports the concept of &ldquo;reusability&rdquo;, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Inheritance in Java</strong></p>
<p>Below are the different types of inheritance which is supported by Java.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single Inheritance :&nbsp;</strong>In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. In image below, the class A serves as a base class for the derived class B.</li>
<li><strong>Multilevel Inheritance :&nbsp;</strong>In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as the derived class also act as the base class to other class. In below image, the class A serves as a base class for the derived class B, which in turn serves as a base class for the derived class C. In Java, a class cannot directly access the<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-91/">grandparent&rsquo;s members</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical Inheritance :&nbsp;</strong>In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one sub class.In below image, the class A serves as a base class for the derived class B,C and D.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-and-multiple-inheritance/"><strong>Multiple Inheritance</strong></a><strong>(Through Interfaces) :&nbsp;</strong>In Multiple inheritance ,one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes. Please note that Java does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;support&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-and-multiple-inheritance/">multiple inheritance</a>&nbsp;with classes. In java, we can achieve multiple inheritance only through&nbsp;<a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/interfaces-in-java/">Interfaces</a>. In image below, Class C is derived from interface A and B</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Inheritance(Through Interfaces) :&nbsp;</strong>It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. Since java doesn&rsquo;t support multiple inheritance with classes, the hybrid inheritance is also not possible with classes. In java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through&nbsp;<a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/interfaces-in-java/">Interfaces</a>.</li>

Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.</p>
<p>The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class.</p>
<p>Therefore, Java doesn&rsquo;t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred to as Diamond Problem.</p>
<h3><span id="what-is-the-diamond-problem-in-inheritance">What is the diamond problem in inheritance?</span></h3>
<p>In case of multiple inheritance, suppose class A has two subclasses B and C, and a class D has two super classes B and C.If a method present in A is overridden by both B and C but not by D then from which class D will inherit that method B or C? This problem is known as diamond problem.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>INTERFACE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/</a></p>
<p>An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants. In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does not contain any constructor. Thus, interface basically is a group of related methods with empty bodies. Example:</p>
<div>public interface Animal {</div>
<div>&nbsp; final int id = 10;</div>
<div>&nbsp; public void eat();</div>
<div>&nbsp; public void sleep();</div>
<div>&nbsp; public void run();</div>
<div>&nbsp; int move();</div>
<div>}</div>
<p>Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract (only method signature, no body). &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.</li>
<li>An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an interface and any class implementing Player must be able to (or must implement) move(). So it specifies a set of methods that the class has to implement.</li>
<li>If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then the class must be declared abstract.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do we use interface ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is used to achieve total abstraction.</li>
<li>Since java does not support multiple inheritance in case of class, but by using interface it can achieve multiple inheritance .</li>
<li>It is also used to achieve loose coupling.</li>
<li>Interfaces are used to implement abstraction. So the question arises why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in interface are final, public and static.</p>
<ul>
<li>To declare an interface, use&nbsp;<strong>interface</strong>&nbsp;It is used to provide total abstraction. That means all the methods in an interface are declared with an empty body and are public and all fields are public, static and final by default. A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface. To implement interface use&nbsp;<strong>implements</strong>keyword.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marker interface in Java</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/marker-interface-java/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/marker-interface-java/</a></p>
<p>It is an empty interface (no field or methods). Examples of marker interface are Serializable, Clonnable and Remote interface. All these interfaces are empty interfaces.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Can a method inside an Interface be declared as final?</strong><br />Not possible. Doing so will result in compilation error. Final method can not be override. public and abstract are the only applicable modifiers for method declaration in an interface</p>
<p><strong>Why is an Interface able to extend more than one Interface but a Class can't extend more than one Class?</strong><br />Basically Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance, so a Class is restricted to extend only one Class. But an Interface is a pure abstraction model and doesn't have inheritance hierarchy like classes (do remember that the base class of all classes is Object). So an Interface is allowed to extend more than one Interface.</p>
<p><strong>What modifiers are allowed for methods in an Interface?</strong><br />Only public and abstract modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.<br />In this case, an interface is intended to serve as a public protocol for communicating with an object.</p>
<p><strong>What is a marker interface?</strong></p>
<p>A Marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and member functions. In simpler terms, an empty interface is called the Marker interface. The most common examples of Marker interface in Java are Serializable, Cloneable etc. The marker interface can be declared as follows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;IS-A&rdquo; relationship implies inheritance. A sub class object is said to have &ldquo;IS-A&rdquo; relationship with the super class or interface. If class A extends B then A &ldquo;IS-A&rdquo; B. It is transitive, that is, if class A extends B and class B extends C then A &ldquo;IS-A&rdquo; C. The &ldquo;instanceof&rdquo; operator in java determines the &ldquo;IS-A&rdquo; relationship.</p>
<p>When a class A has a member reference variable of type B then A &ldquo;HAS-A&rdquo; B. It is also known as Aggregation.</p>
<h3><span id="what-is-association">What is Association?</span></h3>
<p>Association is a relationship between two objects with multiplicity.</p>
<p>Association is a relationship where all object have their own lifecycle and there is no owner. Let&rsquo;s take the example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and a single student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. These relationships can be one to one, one to many, many to one and many to many.</p>

<p>Aggregation is also known as &ldquo;HAS-A&rdquo; relationship. When class Car has a member reference variable of type Wheel then the relationship between the classes Car and Wheel is known as Aggregation. Aggregation can be understood as &ldquo;whole to its parts&rdquo; relationship.</p>
<p>Car is the whole and Wheel is part. Wheel can exist without the Car. Aggregation is a weak association.</p>
<p>An aggregation is a specialized form of Association where all object has their own lifecycle but there is ownership and child object can not belong to another parent object. Let&rsquo;s take an example of Department and teacher. A single teacher can not belong to multiple departments, but if we delete the department teacher object will not destroy.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id="what-is-composition">What is Composition?</span></h3>
<p>Composition is a special form of Aggregation where the part cannot exist without the whole. Composition is a strong Association. Composition relationship is represented like aggregation with one difference that the diamond shape is filled.</p>
<p>Composition is again a specialized form of Aggregation and we can call this as a &ldquo;death&rdquo; relationship. It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object does not have their lifecycle and if parent object deletes all child object will also be deleted. Let&rsquo;s take again an example of a relationship between House and rooms. House can contain multiple rooms there is no independent life of room and any room can not belongs to two different houses if we delete the house room will automatically delete.</p>

<p><strong>Package</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/">Java</a>&nbsp;is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces. Packages are used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing naming conflicts. For example there can be two classes with name Employee in two packages, college.staff.cse.Employee and college.staff.ee.Employee</li>
<li>Making searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier</li>
<li>Providing controlled access: protected and default have package level access control. A protected member is accessible by classes in the same package and its subclasses. A default member (without any access specifier) is accessible by classes in the same package only.</li>
<li>Packages can be considered as data encapsulation (or data-hiding).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Classes and Objects in Java</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/</a></p>
<p>Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real life entities.</p>
<p><strong>Class</strong></p>
<p>A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.&nbsp; A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the syntax of a class.</p>
<div>
<div id="highlighter_938152" class="syntaxhighlighter  java">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. &nbsp;It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Modifiers</strong>: A class can be public or has default access (Refer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-specifiers-for-classes-or-interfaces-in-java/">this</a>&nbsp;for details).</li>
<li><strong>Class name:</strong>The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).</li>
<li><strong>Superclass(if any):</strong>The name of the class&rsquo;s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.</li>
<li><strong>Interfaces(if any):</strong>A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong>The class body&nbsp;surrounded by braces, { }.</li>
</ol>
<p>Constructors are used for initializing new objects. Fields are variables that provides the state of the class and its objects, and methods are used to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.</p>
<p>There are various types of classes that are used in real time applications such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inner-class-java/">nested classes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/anonymous-inner-class-java/">anonymous classes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lambda-expressions-java-8/">lambda expressions</a>.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Object</strong></p>
<p>It is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming&nbsp;and represents the real life entities. &nbsp;A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>State&nbsp;</strong>: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.</li>
<li><strong>Behavior&nbsp;</strong>: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.</li>
<li><strong>Identity&nbsp;</strong>: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ways to create object of a class</strong></p>
<p>There are four ways to create objects in java.Strictly speaking there is only one way(by using&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;keyword),and the rest internally use&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;keyword.</p>
<p><strong>Using new keyword&nbsp;</strong>: It is the most common and general way to create object in java.&nbsp;Example:</p>
<p>Test t = new Test();</p>
<p><strong>Using Class.forName(String className) method&nbsp;</strong>: There is a pre-defined class in java.lang package with name Class. The forName(String className) method returns the Class object associated with the class with the given string name.We have to give the fully qualified name for a class. On calling new Instance() method on this Class object returns new instance of the class with the given string name.</p>
<p>Test obj = (Test)Class.forName("com.p1.Test").newInstance();</p>
<p><strong>Using clone() method</strong>: clone() method is present in Object class. It creates and returns a copy of the object.</p>
<p>t1 = new Test();</p>
<p>Test t2 = (Test)t1.clone();</p>
<p><strong>Deserialization&nbsp;</strong>: De-serialization is technique of reading an object from the saved state in a file. Refer&nbsp;<a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/serialization-in-java/">Serialization/De-Serialization in java</a></p>
<p>FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(filename);</p>
<p>ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(file);</p>
<p>Object obj = in.readObject()</p>
<p><strong>What is object cloning in Java?</strong></p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="dp-highlighter">
<p>Object cloning in Java is the process of creating an exact copy of an object. It basically means the ability to create an object with a similar state as the original object. To achieve this, Java provides a method&nbsp;<strong>clone</strong><strong>()</strong>&nbsp;to make use of this functionality. This method creates a new instance of the class of the current object and then initializes all its fields with the exact same contents of corresponding fields. To object clone(), the marker interface&nbsp;<strong>java.lang.Cloneable&nbsp;</strong>must be implemented to avoid any runtime exceptions. One thing you must note is Object clone() is a protected method, thus you need to override it.</p>
<p>Object cloning means to create an exact copy of the original object.&nbsp;If a class needs to support cloning, it must implement java.lang.Cloneable interface and override clone() method from Object class. Syntax of the clone() method is :</p>
<p>protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException</p>
<p>If the object&rsquo;s class doesn&rsquo;t implement Cloneable interface then it throws an exception &lsquo;CloneNotSupportedException&rsquo; .</p>

<h1>Methods in Java</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/methods-in-java/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/methods-in-java/</a></p>
<p>A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods allow us to&nbsp;<strong>reuse</strong>&nbsp;the code without retyping the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method Declaration</strong></p>
<p>In general, method declarations has six components :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modifier</strong>-: Defines&nbsp;<strong>access type</strong>of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In Java, there 4 type of the access specifiers.
<ul>
<li>public: accessible in all class in your application.</li>
<li>protected: accessible within the class in which it is defined and in its&nbsp;<strong>subclass(es)</strong></li>
<li>private: accessible only within the class in which it is defined.</li>
<li>default (declared/defined without using any modifier) : accessible within same class and package within which its class is defined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The return type</strong>: The data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value.</li>
<li><strong>Method Name</strong>: the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.</li>
<li><strong>Parameter list&nbsp;</strong>: Comma separated list of the input parameters are defined, preceded with their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().</li>
<li><strong>Exception list&nbsp;</strong>: The exceptions you expect by the method can throw, you can specify these exception(s).</li>
<li><strong>Method body&nbsp;</strong>: it is enclosed between braces. The code you need to be executed to perform your intended operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Memory allocation for methods calls</strong></p>
<p>Methods calls are implemented through stack. Whenever a method is called a stack frame is created within the stack area and after that the arguments passed to and the local variables and value to be returned by this called method are stored in this stack frame and when execution of the called method is finished, the allocated stack frame would be deleted. There is a stack pointer register that tracks the top of the stack&nbsp;which is adjusted accordingly.</p>
