<p><strong>What do you understand by the payload in RESTFul?</strong><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Payload means data that passed inside the request body; also, the payload is not request parameters. So only you can do payload in POST and not in GET and DELETE method</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between SOAP and RESTFul web services?</strong><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> There is much difference between these two styles of web services, e.g. SOAP takes more bandwidth because of heavyweight XML based protocol, but REST takes less bandwidth because of widespread use of JSON as message protocol and leveraging HTTP method to define action. This also means that REST is faster than SOAP-based web services.</p>
<p><strong>How much maximum payload you could do in the POST method?</strong><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> If you remember the difference between the GET and POST request, then you know that unlike GET, which passes data on URL and thus limited by maximum URL length, POST has no such limit. So, theoretically, you can pass unlimited data as payload to the POST method. Still, you need to take practical things into account, like sending a POST with a large payload will consume more bandwidth, take more time and present performance challenge to your server.</p>
<p><strong>What framework you had used to develop RESTFul services?</strong><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a real experience-based question. If you have used Jersey to develop RESTFul web services, then answer as Jersey but expect some follow-up question on Jersey. Similarly, if you have used Apache CFX or Restlet, then respond to them accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>What is a &lsquo;Resource&rsquo;?</strong><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Just like the &lsquo;Object&rsquo; instance, we have learned in Object Orient Programming Language, in the same way, &lsquo;Resource&rsquo; is defined as an object of a type which can be an image, HTML file, text data, and any type of dynamic data. There are varieties of representation formats available in order to represent a resource.<br />Some most common Resources are enlisted below:<br />JSON<br />YAML<br />XML<br />HTML</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between the PUT method and the POST method?</strong><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The major difference between the PUT and POST method is that the result generated with the PUT method is always the same no matter how many times the operation is performed. On the other hand, the result generated by POST operation is always different every time.</p>
<p><strong><label>What should be the purpose of OPTIONS method of RESTful web services?</label></strong></p>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It should list down the supported operations in a web service and should be read only.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>What are HTTP status codes? Enlist few with meaning.</strong><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> HTTP status codes basically are the representation of the status of the task that has been performed on the server, with the mode of some codes. Every code has their own meaning.<br />Some of the HTTP status codes with their meaning are as follows:<br />Code 200: This indicates success.<br />Code 201: This indicates resource has been successfully created.<br />Code 204: This indicates that there is no content in the response body.<br />Code 404: This indicates that there is no method available.</p>

<p><strong>Which protocol is used by RESTful webservices?</strong></p>
<p>RESTful web services make use of HTTP protocol as a medium of communication between client and server.</p>
<p><strong><label>What is messaging in RESTful webservices?</label></strong></p>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>A client sends a message in form of a HTTP Request and server responds in form of a HTTP Response. This technique is termed as Messaging. These messages contain message data and metadata i.e. information about message itself.</p>
