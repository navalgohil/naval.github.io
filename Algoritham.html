<p><strong>What is Big-O notation? Give some examples?</strong><br />The Big-O notation describes the performance of an algorithm in terms of number of elements in a data structure. Since Collection classes are actually data structures, we usually tend to use Big-O notation to choose the collection implementation to use based on time, memory and performance.<br />Example 1: ArrayList get(index i) is a constant-time operation and doesn&rsquo;t depend on the number of elements in the list. So it&rsquo;s performance in Big-O notation is O(1). Example 2: A linear search on array or list performance is O(n) because we need to search through entire list of elements to find the element.</p>
